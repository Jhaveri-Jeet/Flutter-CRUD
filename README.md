# Flutter To-Do App with API Sync

Welcome to our Flutter To-Do App! This application allows you to manage your tasks seamlessly across devices, thanks to API synchronization. Below, you'll find essential information to get started.

## Features

- **Add:** Easily add new tasks with titles and descriptions.
- **View:** Browse your to-do list with a user-friendly interface.

## API Integration

This app leverages an external API to store and sync tasks in real-time. The provided implementation uses a .NET API, but you can replace it with any API of your choice.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Configure API Endpoint:**
   - Open the project and locate the API configuration file (e.g., `lib/api_config.dart`).
   - Update the `apiEndpoint` variable with your API's base URL.

5. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username` and `your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name. Additionally, adjust the API configuration instructions based on the actual structure of your Flutter project.
